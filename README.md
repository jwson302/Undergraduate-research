Governing equations

x-direction

$$\rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right)
 = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}+2\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\eta \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
